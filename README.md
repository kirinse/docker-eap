# docker-eap

Simple docker file to handle my [JBoss EAP](http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/overview/) base image. This is by no means a production grade image, it's there to get something up fast. If you want help with Red Hat EAP Suite and Docker in production environment, [contact Red Hat Consulting](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/business-automation).

Master branch will have latest, and then each branch will keep version specific.
